# Student Management System

## Description
This is a CLI-based application designed to manage student enrollment in courses. This system allows the creation and management of courses, student records, and the association between students and the courses they are enrolled in. It also provides functionalities for listing courses, enrolling students, and generating certificates based on student performance. This system can be easily expanded and serves as a simple yet efficient solution for educational institutions, or anyone interested in managing student-course registrations programmatically.

## Technologies
- **Python 3.9+**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **SQLite3**: A lightweight SQL database used for storing and managing persistent data related to students and courses.
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for interacting with the application.

### Required Python Libraries:
- `sqlite3`: For handling database operations in Python.
